## What the App Does

CrewPay is a construction crew job-execution platform. Foremen create jobs, assign tasks to workers, and track labor in real time. Workers check in, clock off, and get paid based on budgeted hours — giving them a direct incentive to work efficiently. The app handles pay calculation, bonus logic, margin tracking, and crew management.

## Project Status

| Layer | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `crewpay-demo-v4.html` | ✅ Feature-complete (v4) | Single-file React demo, opens directly in browser |
| `crewpay-app/` | 🚧 v1 scaffold | Next.js + Supabase app; core auth + task flow only |
| `crewpay-app-v2.zip` | 🚧 v2 scaffold | Adds team invite join flow, additional pages |

**The HTML demo (`crewpay-demo-v4.html`) is the source of truth for product features.** The Next.js app needs to catch up. All v4 features exist only in the demo today.

## Routes & Pages

| Route | Role | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | Public | Login + signup. Role picker (foreman/worker). Redirects after auth. |
| `/foreman/dashboard` | Foreman | Lists active jobs, expandable task list per job, on-time rate, worker assignment |
| `/foreman/jobs/new` | Foreman | Create job + add tasks inline with worker assignment |
| `/worker` | Worker | Worker's assigned task list — check in, clock off, view pay |

> **v4 Demo routes not yet in Next.js app:**
> - Rate Sheet (market rates, OT/night/rush multipliers, CSV export)
> - Team management (add worker, invite link, margin flags)
> - Jobs list with gross margin per project
> - Change order request + foreman approval flow

## Database Tables

All tables live in Supabase. Row-level security is enabled on every table.

### `profiles`
Extends `auth.users`. One row per user.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | uuid | FK → auth.users |
| `full_name` | text | |
| `role` | text | `'foreman'` or `'worker'` |
| `trade` | text | e.g. "Framing", "Electrical" |
| `rate_per_hour` | numeric | Worker's cost rate (used for pay calc) |
| `company_id` | uuid | FK → companies |

### `companies`
One company per foreman account (created on first login).

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | uuid | |
| `name` | text | |
| `owner_id` | uuid | FK → profiles |

### `jobs`
| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | uuid | |
| `company_id` | uuid | FK → companies |
| `name` | text | |
| `status` | text | `active`, `completed`, `archived` |
| `created_by` | uuid | FK → profiles |
| `completed_at` | timestamptz | nullable |

> **Pending v4 additions:** `location text`, `contract_value numeric`, `bonus_enabled boolean`

### `tasks`
| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | uuid | |
| `job_id` | uuid | FK → jobs |
| `name` | text | |
| `worker_id` | uuid | FK → profiles (nullable) |
| `estimated_hours` | numeric | **Pay basis** — worker earns on this, not actual |
| `actual_hours` | numeric | Nullable until task is completed |
| `status` | text | `pending`, `in_progress`, `completed` |
| `bonus_enabled` | boolean | Inherited from job-level toggle |
| `checked_in_at` | timestamptz | |
| `completed_at` | timestamptz | |

> **Pending v4 additions:** `miles numeric`, `clock_off_note text`, `rate_code text`

### `payments`
Auto-generated when a task is completed.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `task_id` | uuid | FK → tasks |
| `worker_id` | uuid | FK → profiles |
| `base_pay` | numeric | `estimated_hours × rate_per_hour` |
| `bonus_pay` | numeric | 10% of base if on time |
| `total_pay` | numeric | |
| `status` | text | `pending`, `approved`, `paid` |

> **Pending v4 addition:** separate `change_orders` table

## Auth Flow

1. User lands on `/` (login/signup)
2. **Sign up:** Creates `auth.users` entry via Supabase, then inserts into `profiles` (name, role, trade, rate)
3. **Login:** `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword` → fetches `profiles.role` → redirects to `/foreman/dashboard` or `/worker`
4. **Session:** Managed by `@supabase/ssr` — cookies persisted server-side
5. **Sign out:** Clears session, redirects to `/`
6. **RLS:** All DB queries are automatically scoped — workers can only see their own tasks; foremen see their company's data

---

## Key Business Logic

### Pay Calculation (intentional design)
Workers are paid on **budgeted hours, not actual hours**. This incentivizes speed.

```
base_pay   = estimated_hours × rate_per_hour
bonus_pay  = base_pay × 0.10  (only if actual_hours ≤ estimated_hours AND job.bonus_enabled)
total_pay  = base_pay + bonus_pay
```

### Gross Margin (v4 demo logic — not yet in Next.js app)
Margin is calculated from **completed tasks only**, using contractor billing rates (not worker wages).

```
revenue = completed_task.est_hours × worker.targetMarket   (market billing rate)
cost    = completed_task.est_hours × worker.rate
profit  = revenue - cost
margin% = profit / revenue × 100
```

Target: 3× multiplier (market rate = 3× worker cost rate).

### Rate Multipliers (v4 demo — not yet in Next.js app)
Stackable multipliers applied to market rates:
- OT / Weekend: default 1.5× (adjustable)
- Night / Graveyard: default 2.0× (adjustable)
- Rush: default 1.5× (stackable on top of others)

## Computed Helpers (`lib/types.ts`)

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `calcBasePay(task, worker)` | `estimated_hours × rate_per_hour` |
| `calcBonus(task, worker)` | 10% of base if completed on time and bonus enabled |
| `calcTotal(task, worker)` | `base + bonus` |
| `jobProgress(job)` | `{ done, total, pct }` from task statuses |
| `onTimeRate(tasks)` | % of completed tasks finished under estimated hours |

## v4 Feature Backlog (demo → Next.js app)

These features exist in `crewpay-demo-v4.html` and need to be built into the Next.js app:

- [ ] **Rate Sheet tab** — editable market rate + cost rate, OT/night/rush multipliers, CSV export, competitive market benchmarks (residential vs. commercial), rate as task picklist
- [ ] **Gross margin per job** — revenue from completed tasks × billing rate
- [ ] **Change order flow** — worker submits → pending badge → foreman approves/rejects
- [ ] **Worker profile** — avg effective pay rate, below-margin flag
- [ ] **Jobs list enhancements** — location field, mileage tracking ($0.67/mi IRS rate)
- [ ] **Dashboard** — labor margin stat, on-time tracking, quick-add task inline
- [ ] **Bonus toggle** — job-level; visible to worker on task card
- [ ] **Clock-off note** — required note when task is incomplete at clock-off
- [ ] **DB schema additions** — `jobs.location`, `jobs.contract_value`, `jobs.bonus_enabled`, `tasks.miles`, `tasks.clock_off_note`, `tasks.rate_code`, new `change_orders` table, new `rate_sheet` table

---

## Development Guardrails

This project follows the **Clean Dev Protocol**. Key rules:

1. **One feature at a time** — branch → implement → test → commit → repeat
2. **Test after every change** — don't stack changes without verifying
3. **Branch naming:** `feature/rate-sheet`, `fix/auth-redirect`, `chore/schema-migration`
4. **Never commit to main directly** — all work goes through feature branches
5. **Diagnose before rewriting** — read the error, patch the minimum needed
6. **Update this file** when adding routes, tables, or integrations

Full protocol: `/mnt/.claude/skills/clean-dev-protocol/SKILL.md`
